  <h1 align="center">Library System</h1>
  
  <p align="center">The system allows librarians to check out books for library members, while administrators can manage the library collection and membership. Administrators can add new books, create new library member profiles, and update member information.</p>

## Design Approach

The project involves designing and implementing a system in Java. The design process includes creating class diagrams to represent attributes, operations, associations, and inheritance relationships. Sequence diagrams will be developed to model various use cases, ensuring functionality aligns with the requirements. The user interface will be designed using Java Swing, providing a usable front-end experience. Instead of interacting with a database, the system will employ object serialization for reading and writing data.
